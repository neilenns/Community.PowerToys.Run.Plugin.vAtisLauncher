## Development notes

This project is based on the [Community.PowerToys.Run.Plugin.Templates](https://github.com/hlaueriksson/Community.PowerToys.Run.Plugin.Templates)
template.

This repo uses GitHub workflows to add CI/CD for a PowerToys plugin project. All pull requests get validated
by building for x64 and ARM64. Releases are automated as well and the plugin gets the version of the GitHub
release. See the `.github/workflows` folder for the workflows that take care of this.
